# About Me
Hi there! I recently graduated from the College of the Holy Cross with a degree in computer science with a minor in philosophy. 
I am currently working at CMIT Solutions of Boston | Cambridge as a help desk engineer. 

## Current Projects
- I have a few projects that are currently very early in development. 

## Past Projects
- IggyBot/IggyPy -- A multifunction Discord bot designed specifically for the Crusader Gaming Hub server. This bot handles user verification, high-priority announcement delivery, poll management, and other minor functions.
- Rust Truth Table Generator -- Originally produced as a term project for a course in programming languages design and implementation, highlighting Rust. 
- CrusaderPlugin -- A custom multifunction plugin for the CrusaderCraft Minecraft server.
