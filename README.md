# About Me
Hi there! I graduated from the College of the Holy Cross with a bachelor's degree in computer science and a minor in philosophy. 
I currently work at **Mantra Computing** as an IT consultant. My ultimate goal is to work in software development.

## Past Projects
- IggyBot/IggyPy -- A multifunction Discord bot designed specifically for the Crusader Gaming Hub server. This bot handles user verification, high-priority announcement delivery, poll management, and other minor functions.
- Rust Truth Table Generator -- Originally produced as a term project for a course in programming languages design and implementation, highlighting Rust. 
- Geolocation Cluster -- A project for my Computer Networking course which involved estimating a user's distance from a specified web server based on observed latency from several worker nodes in various datacenters.
